Current Functionality
- Box which counts number of things inside it
- Text UI which displays the number of objects inside
- Balls that are dropped into the box

Ideas:
- Peggle style game but the pegs become balls and you are trying to get them into the bucket at the bottom
- Shoot balls (fixed number)
- Let pegs turn into balls when hit and funnel down
- When no balls left, allow another shot
- Level has none ball pegs too
